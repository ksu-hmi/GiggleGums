# What is Tooth-Fairy project?
Tooth-Fairy is an innovative game designed to educate and empower kids (pedodontic patients) about oral hygiene and dental facts. This interactive and engaging game aims to make learning about dental care fun and accessible, while promoting good oral health habits. 

# Why the project is useful?


# Tooth Fairy App Goal
The dental industry, a significant branch of healthcare, often doesn't receive the recognition and resources it truly deserves in terms of the benefits it can offer to patients. While there are numerous online resources available for basic oral hygiene quizzes, the Tooth Fairy app distinguishes itself by providing an interactive and open-source platform. This application is specifically designed to educate children about oral hygiene, offering a unique and engaging experience.

# How it Works
This application is designed for kids to enjoy while they wait for their dentist appointment check-in. The app features a range of difficulty levels, starting from easy and progressing to more challenging, all focused on fundamental oral hygiene questions. It serves as an engaging activity to keep them occupied while the dental office staff completes the check-in procedure. In case a question is answered incorrectly, the app provides feedback. As children advance to higher levels, we've included hints to assist them in tackling the more difficult questions.
