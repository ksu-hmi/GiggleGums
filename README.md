# ðŸª¥ðŸ¦· IntroductionðŸª¥ðŸ¦·
GiggleGums is an innovative game designed to educate and empower kids (pediatric patients) about oral hygiene and dental facts. This interactive and engaging game aims to make learning about dental care fun and accessible while promoting good oral hygiene habits. 

# GiggleGums App Goal 
The dental industry, a significant branch of healthcare, often doesn't receive the recognition and resources it truly deserves in terms of the benefits it can offer to patients. While there are numerous online resources available for basic oral hygiene quizzes, the GiggleGums app distinguishes itself by providing an interactive source of comprehensive oral care knowledge. This application is specifically designed to educate young children about oral hygiene, offering a unique and engaging experience. By reducing the amount of time dental assistants spend reassuring patients and reducing their fear, this software is anticipated to simplify the care of pediatric patients at the dental office. The management of such patients would be improved as a result of this efficiency.

# How it Works
GiggleGums application is designed for kids to stay engaged while they wait for their dentist appointment check-in. The app features quizzes related to oral hygiene practices with a range of difficulty levels, starting from easy and progressing to more challenging levels. It serves as an interesting and fun activity to keep them occupied while the dental office staff completes the check-in procedure. In case a question is answered incorrectly, the app provides feedback. As children advance to higher levels, we've included hints to assist them in tackling the more difficult questions. The app instructs kids on the appropriate procedures to follow while seeing a dentist in addition to increasing awareness of oral cleanliness. By mentally preparing them for prospective procedures, this preparation helps reduce anxiety and makes it easier for dental practitioners to provide treatment. Kids' comprehension of the quizzes is made simpler and more memorable by the inclusion of graphic answers. We are aware that visual aids help with comprehension and memory and hence we included a graphical representation of the quiz options.
